I chose **C#** and **Java** as my core technologies because they provide a strong, stable, and future-proof foundation for backend engineering. Both offer powerful ecosystems, robust type systems, and mature tooling ideal for building scalable and maintainable systems. C# stands out with its elegant syntax, seamless integration with .NET, and productivity-oriented tooling. Java excels in enterprise scalability, JVM portability, and a massive ecosystem like Spring Boot. Together, they give me the flexibility, performance, and reliability to tackle modern backend challenges with confidence.
